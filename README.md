This project is a soccer leaderboards simulator, with some functionalities like login (only admin can edit the matches), you can only edit matches that are in progress and can finish them, making the leaderboards update automatically with all the major stats (numbers of matches per team, points, goals scored, etc).

It was made to practice typescript, mysql, sequelize, express, docker containerization and tests.
